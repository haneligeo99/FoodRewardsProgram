This Food Rewards Program is a student project that aims to tackle food insecurity among college students. Students are given a RewardsNo and 200 points upon signing up. Those points can be used to redeem free food at any of the food establishments on campus. As students buy food using their RewardsNo, they can accumulate more points over time. They can choose to save them up or redeem any food item with enough points. The goal at hand is to provide students better access to nutritious meals!
