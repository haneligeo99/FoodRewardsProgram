# FoodRewardsProgram

This Food Rewards Program is a student project that aims to tackle this problem by giving students access free food on their own campuses. Students are given a RewardsNo and 150 points upon signing up. Those points can be used to redeem free food at any of the food establishments on campus. As students buy food using their RewardsNo, they can accumulate more points over time. They can choose to save them up or redeem any food item with enough points. The goal at hand is to provide students better access to nutritious meals! 

This was created using HTML, PHP, and mySQL as the database. I also included a C++ version in a replit file.
