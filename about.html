<h2> Food Insecurity Among College Students</h2>
<p1> &emsp; Did you know that approximately 1.5 million New Yorkers are struggling to feed themselves and their families right now? This means that 1 in 4 New Yorkers lack reliable access to food. Many of those people are students on college campuses all around NYC. </p1><br><br>


<img src="hungerCollege.jpg" alt="Food Insecurity Stats" class="center"><br>
<p2>&emsp;The chart above depicts the results from a survey conducted by the National Student Campaign Against Hunger and Homelessness. After talking to over 3,000 students at different campuses, they found that over half had experienced food insecurity, 22 percent of students said their food insecurity qualifies them as hungry and 20 percent said they have, at least once, not eaten for a whole day because there wasnâ€™t enough money for food.</p2><br>

<h2>How can the Food Rewards Program help?</h2>
<p3> &emsp; This Food Rewards Program is a student project that aims to tackle this problem by giving students access free food on their own campuses. Students are given a RewardsNo and 150 points upon signing up. Those points can be used to redeem free food at any of the food establishments on campus. As students buy food using their RewardsNo, they can accumulate more points over time. They can choose to save them up or redeem any food item with enough points. The goal at hand is to provide students better access to nutritious meals!  </p3> <br><br>
